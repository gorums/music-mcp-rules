    Generate comprehensive collection analytics and insights.
    
    This tool performs deep analysis of your entire music collection and provides actionable insights.
    No parameters needed - it analyzes your complete collection automatically.
    
    WHAT THIS TOOL ANALYZES:
    
    1. Collection Maturity Assessment:
       - Beginner: 1-9 bands, 1-24 albums, 1-2 album types
       - Intermediate: 10-24 bands, 25-74 albums, 3-4 album types  
       - Advanced: 25-49 bands, 75-199 albums, 5-6 album types
       - Expert: 50-99 bands, 200-499 albums, 6-7 album types
       - Master: 100+ bands, 500+ albums, 7-8 album types
    
    2. Album Type Distribution Analysis:
       - Compares your collection against ideal ratios
       - Ideal: Album 55%, EP 15%, Demo 10%, Live 8%, Compilation 5%, Instrumental 4%, Split 2%, Single 1%
       - Identifies missing or underrepresented album types
       - Calculates type diversity score (0-100)
    
    3. Collection Health Metrics (0-100 scores):
       - Overall Health: Composite score of all factors
       - Type Diversity: How well-balanced your album types are
       - Genre Diversity: Variety of musical genres represented
       - Completion Score: Ratio of local vs missing albums
       - Organization Score: Folder structure and naming compliance
       - Quality Score: Based on ratings and analysis data
    
    4. Edition Analysis:
       - Tracks Deluxe, Limited, Anniversary, Remastered editions
       - Identifies upgrade opportunities (Standard â†’ Deluxe)
       - Calculates edition prevalence percentages
    
    5. Personalized Recommendations:
       - Missing album type suggestions for each band
       - Edition upgrade opportunities
       - Organization improvement suggestions
       - Collection completion strategies
    
    6. Value and Rarity Assessment:
       - Collection value score based on rare items
       - Limited editions, early albums, demos boost value
       - Instrumental and split releases add rarity points
    
    7. Discovery Potential:
       - Identifies opportunities for music discovery
       - Based on collection patterns and similar band networks
       - Suggests expansion directions
    
    8. Pattern Analysis:
       - Decade distribution (which eras you prefer)
       - Genre trends and preferences
       - Band completion rates (how complete each band's discography is)
       - Collection growth patterns
    
    EXAMPLE INSIGHTS YOU'LL GET:
    - "Your collection is Expert level with strong Metal representation"
    - "You're missing EPs for 12 bands - consider adding Metallica's 'Creeping Death EP'"
    - "85% of your albums are local, 15% missing - good completion rate"
    - "Your collection value is High due to 23 limited editions and 15 demo recordings"
    - "Type diversity: 78/100 - well-balanced but could use more Live albums"
    - "Discovery potential: High - 47 similar bands identified for expansion"
    
    WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
    - After scanning your collection for the first time
    - To get recommendations for collection improvement
    - To track your collection's growth and health over time
    - To identify gaps in your collection

    - Before planning music purchases or acquisitions
    
    Returns:
        Dict containing comprehensive collection insights:
        - status: 'success' or 'error' 
        - insights: Complete analytics object with all detailed analysis
        - collection_maturity: Your collection's maturity level (Beginner to Master)
        - health_summary: Key health metrics and top recommendations
        - type_analysis_summary: Album type distribution vs ideal ratios
        - recommendations_summary: Top recommendations by category with counts
        - analytics_metadata: Analysis details (bands analyzed, timestamp, etc.)
