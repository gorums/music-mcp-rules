**Structure Detection Examples**:

**Default Structure Band**:
```
Slash/
├── 2010 - Slash/
├── 2012 - Apocalyptic Love (Deluxe Edition)/
└── 2014 - World on Fire/
→ folder_structure.type = "default"
```

**Enhanced Structure Band**:
```
AC/DC/
├── Album/
│   ├── 1980 - Back in Black/
│   └── 1990 - The Razors Edge/
├── Live/
│   └── 1991 - Live at Donington/
└── Compilation/
    └── 2003 - The Complete Collection/
→ folder_structure.type = "enhanced"
```

**Mixed Structure Band**:
```
Queen/
├── 1975 - A Night at the Opera/
├── Album/
│   └── 1986 - A Kind of Magic/
└── Live/
    └── 1985 - Live Aid/
→ folder_structure.type = "mixed"
```

**Legacy Structure Band**:
```
The Beatles/
├── Abbey Road/
├── Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band/

**Example Migration Tool Usage**:
```json
{
  "tool": "migrate_band_structure",
  "arguments": {
    "band_name": "Slash",

│   ├── 2012 - Apocalyptic Love (Deluxe Edition)/
│   └── 2014 - World on Fire/
└── Live/
    └── 2019 - Live at the Roxy (Live)/
