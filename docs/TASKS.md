## Discovered Bug Fixes and Tasks During Work

### Bug Fix: Album Update Issue in save_band_metadata_tool - COMPLETED (2025-06-10)
**Issue**: When updating band metadata via `save_band_metadata_tool`, the tool was always overwriting the albums array with existing local albums, even when the user was providing new albums data. This prevented users from properly updating their album collections.

**Root Cause**: In `src/music_mcp_server.py` lines 382-383, the code was unconditionally replacing the albums with existing metadata:
```python
# Bad: always overwrites albums
metadata['albums'] = [album.model_dump() for album in local_metadata.albums]
```

**Fix Applied**: Added proper conditional check to only preserve existing albums when albums key is not provided in input:
```python
# Fixed: only preserve albums if not provided in input
if 'albums' not in metadata:
    metadata['albums'] = [album.model_dump() for album in local_metadata.albums]
```

**Test Results**: 
- **Before**: 2 tests failing (album count mismatch)
- **After**: All 502 tests passing
- **Tests Fixed**: 
  - `tests/test_integration/test_mcp_server.py::TestSaveBandMetadataTool::test_save_band_metadata_update_existing_band`
  - `tests/test_integration/test_analyze_preservation.py::TestAnalyzePreservation::test_preserve_folder_structure_by_default`

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Bug fix verified and all tests passing
