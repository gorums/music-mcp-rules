# Music Collection MCP Server - Development Tasks

## Discovered During Work

### Task: Fix save_band_metadata Analyze Property Preservation - COMPLETED (2025-01-29)
- [x] Identified issue: save_band_metadata_tool was overriding analyze property to null even when existing analyze data was present
- [x] Root cause: BandMetadata creation from input metadata without analyze field defaulted analyze to None, overwriting existing data
- [x] Fixed by modifying save_band_metadata function to add preserve_analyze parameter (default True)
- [x] Updated save_band_metadata_tool to include clear_analyze parameter (default False) for explicit control
- [x] Implemented logic to load existing analyze data and preserve it when preserve_analyze=True
- [x] Added comprehensive response information including analyze_preserved status and analyze_action details
- [x] Updated tool version to 1.1.0 to reflect the new analyze preservation feature
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite in tests/test_analyze_preservation.py with 5 test cases
- [x] Verified backward compatibility - existing behavior preserved by default
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass (30/30 MCP server tests, 46/46 storage tests)

### Task: Fix Collection Summary Test Failure - COMPLETED (2025-01-29)
- [x] Fixed test_large_diverse_collection failing test in TestIntegrationScenarios
- [x] Issue: Collection size threshold logic had `> 100` instead of `>= 100` for large collections
- [x] Fixed _generate_header_section to use `>= 100` for Large Collection badge
- [x] Updated _get_collection_size_status helper function to match logic
- [x] Added boundary test case for exactly 100 bands in test suite
- [x] All collection_summary tests now pass with the corrected threshold logic

### Task: Implement Collection Summary Resource - COMPLETED (2025-01-29)
- [x] Implemented comprehensive collection_summary resource in src/resources/collection_summary.py
- [x] Created get_collection_summary() function with complete markdown generation

### Task: Fix FastMCP Deprecation Warning for log_level Parameter - COMPLETED (2025-05-29)
- [x] Identified deprecation warning: "Passing runtime and transport-specific settings as kwargs to the FastMCP constructor is deprecated (as of 2.3.4)"
- [x] Root cause: Using `log_level="ERROR"` parameter in FastMCP constructor instead of run() method
- [x] Fixed by removing `log_level="ERROR"` from FastMCP("music-collection-mcp", log_level="ERROR") constructor
- [x] Fixed by adding `log_level="ERROR"` to mcp.run(log_level="ERROR") method call as recommended
- [x] Updated implementation maintains ERROR log level to suppress FastMCP initialization messages for MCP client compatibility
- [x] All 242 tests continue to pass (100% success rate) after the fix
- [x] No functional changes - only resolved the deprecation warning

### Task: Fix MCP Client Resource Visibility Issue - COMPLETED (2025-05-29)
- [x] Identified issue: MCP clients (Cline, Claude Desktop) cannot see resources like `band://info/{band_name}`
- [x] Root cause: FastMCP outputs INFO level logs during initialization which MCP clients interpret as errors
- [x] Fixed by setting `log_level="ERROR"` in FastMCP constructor to suppress initialization logs
- [x] Updated basic logging configuration to use ERROR level to minimize output
- [x] Removed excessive development logging messages from main function
- [x] This is a known FastMCP issue - tools work correctly but appear as errors in client UI
- [x] Solution ensures resources, tools, and prompts are properly visible in MCP client interfaces

### Task: Fix Collection Stats Calculation Bug - COMPLETED (2025-01-28)
- [x] Identified issue: Collection stats (total_albums, total_missing_albums) were not being recalculated when collection index was updated
- [x] Root cause: update_collection_index() function was not calling _update_stats() before saving
- [x] Fixed by adding _update_stats() call in update_collection_index() function
- [x] Verified fix works correctly - stats now show proper values (total_albums: 25, total_missing_albums: 23)
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite in tests/test_collection_stats.py to prevent regression
- [x] Tests cover: stats calculation on update, empty collections, no missing albums, all missing albums, add/remove band operations

- [x] Current behavior: Collection stats show total_albums: 28, total_missing_albums: 26 ✅
- [x] Root cause was fixed in previous tasks: Collection Index Override Issue (2025-01-29)
- [x] _create_band_index_entry() now properly merges physical + metadata album counts
- [x] _update_stats() correctly calculates collection totals including missing albums
