4. **Live** (Live recordings) - Keywords: "live", "concert", "unplugged", "acoustic", "live at"
5. **Single** (Single releases) - Keywords: "single"
6. **Demo** (Demo recordings) - Keywords: "demo", "demos", "unreleased", "early recordings"
7. **Instrumental** (Instrumental versions) - Keywords: "instrumental", "instrumentals"
8. **Split** (Split releases) - Keywords: "split", "vs.", "versus", "with"

## Folder Structure Support (4 Patterns)

### 1. Enhanced Structure (Type-Based Organization) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```
Band Name/
├── Album/
│   ├── 1973 - The Dark Side of the Moon/
│   └── 1979 - The Wall (Deluxe Edition)/
├── Live/
│   ├── 1985 - Live at Wembley/
│   └── 1988 - Delicate Sound of Thunder/
├── Compilation/
│   └── 1996 - Greatest Hits/
├── EP/
│   └── 1980 - Running Free EP/
├── Demo/
│   └── 1978 - Early Demos/
└── .band_metadata.json
```

### 2. Default Structure (Flat Organization)
```
Band Name/
├── 1973 - The Dark Side of the Moon/
├── 1979 - The Wall (Deluxe Edition)/
├── 1985 - Live at Wembley (Live)/
├── 1996 - Greatest Hits (Compilation)/

```

### 3. Mixed Structure (Hybrid Organization)
```
Band Name/
├── 1973 - The Dark Side of the Moon/        # Default pattern
├── Live/                                    # Enhanced pattern
│   └── 1985 - Live at Wembley/
└── .band_metadata.json
```

### 4. Legacy Structure (Simple Names)
```

## Separated Album Schema (2.0) - Advanced Data Management

### Core Concept
The system now uses separated arrays for optimal album management and performance:

```json
{
  "band_name": "Pink Floyd",
  "albums": [                    // Local albums (found in folders)
    {
      "album_name": "The Dark Side of the Moon",
      "year": "1973",
      "type": "Album",
      "folder_path": "Album/1973 - The Dark Side of the Moon",
      "track_count": 10,
      "folder_compliance": {
        "score": 95,
        "level": "excellent"
      }
    }
  ],
  "albums_missing": [            // Missing albums (known from metadata)
    {
      "album_name": "The Final Cut",
      "year": "1983",
      "type": "Album"
    }
  ],
  "albums_count": 15,           // Total: local + missing
  "local_albums_count": 12,     // Found in folders
  "missing_albums_count": 3     // Known but not local
}
```

### Development Standards & Practices
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Code formatting with Black (100-character line limit)
- **Import Organization**: Structured imports (standard, third-party, local)
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent `snake_case` functions, `PascalCase` classes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive `MusicMCPError` exception hierarchy
- **Performance**: Optimized for large collections (tested with 10,000+ albums)

### Key Development Patterns
- **Separated Album Schema**: Always use `albums` (local) and `albums_missing` arrays
- **Album Type Detection**: Leverage keyword-based auto-detection in `AlbumTypeDetector`
- **Dependency Injection**: Use `get_config()`, `get_storage_service()` for singletons
- **Atomic Operations**: All storage operations use file locking and backup
- **Progress Reporting**: Implement for operations affecting >50 items
- **Batch Processing**: Use `BatchFileOperations` for file system operations

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: All new code must have corresponding tests
- **Test Organization**: Tests mirror `src/` structure in `tests/` directory
- **Docker Testing**: All tests must pass in Docker environment
- **Performance Testing**: Include tests for large collection scenarios
- **Error Testing**: Test error conditions and recovery scenarios

### Memory for Future Development
When working on this codebase:
1. **Always** read the separated schema in band metadata (`albums` vs `albums_missing`)
2. **Use** the existing album type classification system (8 types with auto-detection)
3. **Follow** the modular architecture - each MCP component in its own file
4. **Leverage** the dependency injection system for services
5. **Implement** comprehensive error handling with the existing exception hierarchy
6. **Add** progress reporting for any operations that might take time
7. **Write** tests first and ensure they pass in Docker environment

## Future Extensibility

The modular architecture supports easy extension:

1. **New Tool Addition**: Create individual tool file following base handler pattern
2. **Custom Album Types**: Extend `AlbumType` enum with new classifications
3. **Additional Structure Types**: Add new patterns to `StructureType` enum
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Extend `CollectionAnalyzer` with new metrics
5. **Custom Compliance Rules**: Add validation rules to compliance system
