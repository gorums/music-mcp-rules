## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for testing and deployment)

### Running the MCP Server

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t music-mcp-server .

# Run the MCP server
docker run -d --name music-mcp-container -v "D:\Projects\music-catalog-mcp\test_music_collection:/music" -e "MUSIC_ROOT_PATH=/music" -it music-mcp-server  
```

## Schema Discovery and Validation

### How MCP Clients Can Discover Correct Metadata Structure

The server provides multiple ways for MCP clients to discover and validate the correct metadata structure:

#### 1. Schema Documentation Resource
```
schema://band_metadata
```
**Purpose**: Get complete BandMetadata schema documentation in markdown format
**Contains**: 
- Required and optional fields with types and examples
- Complete JSON example with proper structure
- Common validation errors table
- Field name corrections guide

#### 2. Validation Tool (Dry-Run)
```json
{
  "tool": "validate_band_metadata_tool",
  "arguments": {
    "band_name": "Pink Floyd",
    "metadata": { ... }
  }
}
```
**Purpose**: Validate metadata structure WITHOUT saving anything
**Returns**:
- Validation status (valid/invalid)
- Detailed error descriptions
- Actionable suggestions to fix issues
- Example corrections for common errors
- Points to schema documentation resource

#### 3. Enhanced Error Messages
The `save_band_metadata_tool` provides comprehensive error reporting when validation fails:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Metadata validation failed: ...",
  "validation_results": {
    "schema_valid": false,
    "validation_errors": ["Specific field errors"],
    "suggestions": ["How to fix each error"]
  }
}
```

### Common Schema Issues and Solutions

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct | Issue |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `"genres": [...]` | `"genre": [...]` | Wrong field name |
| `formed_year: 1965` | `"formed": "1965"` | Integer vs string, wrong name |
| `members: {former: [...], current: [...]}` | `members: [...]` | Nested vs flat structure |
| `"notable_albums": [...]` | `"albums": [...]` | Wrong field name |
| `year: 1973` | `"year": "1973"` | Integer vs string in albums |
| `tracks_count: -1` | `tracks_count: 8` | Negative numbers not allowed |
| `rate: 11` | `rate: 10` | Rating must be 0-10 |

### Client Workflow for Schema Discovery

1. **Test Structure**: Use `validate_band_metadata_tool` to test your metadata structure
2. **Fix Errors**: Follow the suggestions and example corrections provided
3. **Verify**: Re-validate until status is "valid"
4. **Save**: Use `save_band_metadata_tool` when validation passes
5. **Reference**: Access `schema://band_metadata` resource for complete documentation

### Example: Converting Incorrect to Correct Structure

**❌ Original (Incorrect):**
```json
{
  "genres": ["Progressive Rock"],
  "formed_year": 1965,
  "members": {
    "former": ["David Gilmour", "Roger Waters"],
    "current": []
  },
  "notable_albums": [
    {
      "type": "studio",
      "year": 1973,
      "title": "The Dark Side of the Moon"
    }
  ],
  "formed_location": "London, England"
}
```

**✅ Corrected:**
```json
{
  "band_name": "Pink Floyd",
  "formed": "1965",
  "genre": ["Progressive Rock"],
  "origin": "London, England",
  "members": ["David Gilmour", "Roger Waters"],
  "description": "Legendary progressive rock band...",
  "albums": [
    {
      "album_name": "The Dark Side of the Moon",
      "year": "1973",
      "tracks_count": 10,
      "missing": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Client Cannot See Resources/Tools

**Issue**: MCP clients (Cline, Claude Desktop) show connection errors or cannot see resources like `band://info/{band_name}`, tools, or prompts.

**Solution**: This is a common issue with FastMCP-based servers. The problem is that FastMCP outputs INFO-level logs during initialization, which MCP clients interpret as errors.

**Fix Applied**: The server is already configured with `log_level="ERROR"` to suppress these initialization logs. If you still see issues:

1. **Check Client Logs**: Look for actual errors vs. initialization messages
2. **Test Functionality**: Often tools work correctly despite appearing as "errors" in the UI
3. **Retry Connection**: Sometimes reconnecting resolves UI display issues

**Technical Details**: MCP clients expect clean output but FastMCP logs protocol messages like:
```
INFO Processing request of type ListToolsRequest
